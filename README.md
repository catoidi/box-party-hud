# Box Party HUD for GZDOOM

This mod replaces the default GZDOOM HUD with the one from [Box Party](https://github.com/idiotbitz/box-party-demo/), with most features from Box Party intact, and other features cleaned up or rewritten for better compatibility.

***This mod is incompatible with Box Party.***

This mod also requires [GZDOOM 4.7 or above](https://zdoom.org/downloads), because ZScript.

### Features:
- Health, Armor, and Ammo bars.
- Choose between default Mugshots or Box Party Mugshots.
- Customizable HUD shake.
- Optional time and score counters.
- Customizable fonts.

### Key Differences from Box Party:
- Character specific HUD features are removed.
- The reserve ammo and low ammo indicators were removed, for compatibility reasons.
- The combo indicator for the score counter was removed, since the combo system from Box Party is not included.
- Death Message was removed to avoid potential conflicts with other mods.

Feel free to do whatever you want with the code from this mod.
This uses the GPLv3 License because I grabbed some code from gzdoom.pk3.
