# Box Party HUD: a HUD mod for GZDOOM

This mod replaces the default GZDOOM HUD with the one from Box Party, with most features from Box Party intact, and other features cleaned up or rewritten for better compatibility.

This mod is incompatible with Box Party.

Features:
- Health, Armor, and Ammo bars.
- Choose between default Mugshots or Box Party Mugshots.
- Customizable HUD shake.
- Optional time and score counters.
- Customizable fonts.

Key Differences from Box Party:
- Character specific HUD features are removed.
- The reserve ammo and low ammo indicators were removed, for compatibility reasons.
- The combo indicator for the score counter was removed, since the combo system from Box Party is not included.
- Death Message was removed to avoid potential conflicts with other mods.

Feel free to do whatever you want with the code from this mod.
